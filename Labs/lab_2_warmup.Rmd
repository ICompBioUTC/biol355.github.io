```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_list <- list(first_entry = c(1:5), second_entry = letters[1:5])
```

## Get in the zone

1. Create a list consisting of a vector of numbers and a vector of strings.   
2. Check it out with `str`, `names` and `summary` 
3. Find the second element of the first entry of your list. One way to do this is:

```{r}
my_list$first_entry[2]
```
