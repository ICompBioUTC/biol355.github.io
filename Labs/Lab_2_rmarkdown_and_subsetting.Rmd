###Learning objectives

After today's lab you will be able to:

1. Describe the difference between R and Rstudio and distinguish between the 
   console and a script file

2. Create an Rmarkdown document and describe and example of where you would use 
   an Rmarkdown document.
   
3. Describe functions in R and identify the components of a function

4. Describe the difference between [] and () (e.g., when and how to use these 
   different brackets/parentheses)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise

Today we will create an Rmarkdown document to answer the following questions. 
  You have learned that there are some datasets that are built into R. Today we 
  we will play with the `iris` dataset. We will get more practice in familiarising 
  ourselves with a new dataset and will practice subsetting as we have done We are also going to get some practice working 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris
```

1. What are the column names and data types of the different columns in iris?

2. How many rows and columns does iris have?

3. Create a single vector (a new object) called 'width' that is the Sepal.Width 
   column of iris.

4. What is the 100th value in your 'width' vector? 

5. What is the last value in your 'width' vector? Can you write code that 
   returns this value even if you don't know how long 'width' is? 

6. Select rows 10 to 20, with all columns in the iris dataset.

7. Select rows 10 to 20 with only the Species, Petal.Width and Petal.Length. Can 
   you do this two different ways?

8. Select rows 1 to 10, 20, and 100 in the iris dataset. 

9. Select the first value in the Sepal.Length column of the iris 
   dataset. Bonus - can you do this *three* different ways?

10. Without running the following code in R, try to determine which of the 
    following will return the first three rows of the Sepal.Length column in the 
    iris data.frame? For each of the answers that *do not* work, see if you 
    explain why!
  + a) iris[c(1, 2, 3), 'Sepal.Length']
  + b) iris[1, 2, 3, 'Sepal.Length']
  + c) iris[(1, 2, 3), 'Sepal.Length']
  + d) iris['Sepal.Length', c(1, 2, 3)]
