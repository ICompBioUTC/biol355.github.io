  title: "Course Schedule and Readings"  
---  
  While the topics covered are broad, each week will feature different examples from genetics, ecology, molecular, and evolutionary biology highlighting uses of each individual set of techniques.    
  
This course will be a mixture of lecture, live-code demonstrations, and opportunities for in class work. Lecture days will have small exercises for students at the end of class. We will conduct lectures and labs in a computer lab in order for students to be able to follow along and try out new concepts once described and demonstrated in lecture, enabling rapid feedback between students and faculty.
